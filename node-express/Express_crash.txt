Express is a "server-side" or "back-end" framework.
Works in combination with front-end frameworks to build full-stack
web-applications. E.g. build an API with Express, so that it takes requests
from the front-end and it serves back data in JSON format. This data can be 
rendered in the frond-end with html or template engines (handlebars, pug).
